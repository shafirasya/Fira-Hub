            <p> I just become attracted to technology for the last two years, but it has made me explore much about tech and science.
                <span> For me, technology can open up new possibilities for human to develop their self, as well as their surroundings.</span>
                As the STEM field is growing for the past few years, I am interested to pursue a career in that field.
