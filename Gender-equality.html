            <p> I have been attracted to gender equality issue since I was at elementary school. 
                Doing my own research, I became aware and wanted to raised awareness about this topic. 
                I constantly share about my thoughts regarding this issue and I like to pronounce myself as a feminist.
                <span> I think that every person has to be respected and treated regardless of their gender. </span>            </p>
